Next we can take our initial look at the data.

#Part1 - Section 3, Bullet 1,2
This code removes uneeded columns and creates the new variable status2 which defines Good or Bad loans based on status column.
NOTE: removed bcRatio because the other categories from which it is derived are still in the dataset: total credit card balance to total credit card limits. Additionally it has a large amount of NAs. See accompanying report for further justifications.
```{r}
#we'll use mutate to create the dataframe we want for the predictors
loan_predictors <- loans %>%
  select(-loanID, -employment, -bcRatio) %>% #removes uneeded columns
  #conditionals for assignment to "Good", "Bad", NA
  mutate(status2= ifelse(status == "Fully Paid", "Good",
                   ifelse(status == "Charged Off" | status == "Default", 
                          "Bad", NA)))%>%
  select(1:status, status2, everything()) #puts status2 col next to old status col for easy comparison

#head(loan_predictors) #test print
```
Next, we'll create a plot to show what we just did for the report.
```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
#this code gives a good summary of the consolidated rows
p1 <- ggplot(data=loans, aes(x=status)) + 
      geom_bar(fill= c("azure3", "#F21A00", "azure3", "#F21A00",
                       "#3B9AB2", "#ccd5dd", "azure3", "azure3"))+
      xlab("status Variable")+
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
p2 <- ggplot(data=loan_predictors, aes(x=status2)) + 
      geom_bar(fill= c("#F21A00", "#3B9AB2", "azure3")) + 
      xlab("status2 Variable") +
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=2, top = textGrob("Side by Side of Consolidation of Status Variable"))
```
Using the summary function we are able to explore ancillary values. 
```{r, results='hide'}
summary(loan_predictors)
```
Notice about 19 rows have only one NA which is a good indicator that it's the same row. We'll run code to eliminate the NAs from our new status2 variable and see if it fixes the issue.
```{r, results='hide'}
#remove all rows with NAs in status2 from data frame since they are not to be included in the data
#leaving only Good and Bad loans
NAstatus2 <- which(is.na(loan_predictors$status2))
# NAstatus2[1:100]
# length(NAstatus2) #troubleshooting print

loan_predictors2 <- loan_predictors[-NAstatus2,] #remove row w NAs
summary(loan_predictors2) #check summary again
nrow(loan_predictors2) #counts rows left in dataset
```
The previous code DID eliminate the abberant row with NAs throughout since it was classified as neither Good nor Bad. Also note that we reduced the sample size down from 50,000 to 34,655. We'll have to be cognizant moving forward what rows we eliminate, though 34,655 is still a robust sample size.  

#Part1 - Section 3, Bullet 3
Next we'll consolidate categorical variables with only a few counts and lump together.
```{r}
#we'll use mutate to create the dataframe we want for the predictors
loan_predictors3 <- loan_predictors2 %>%
  #conditionals for feature engineering, consolidate "reason" variable
  mutate(reason2= ifelse(reason=="major_purchase"|reason=="car"|reason=="house"|
                           reason=="vacation"|reason=="moving"|reason=="medical"|
                           reason=="renewable_energy"|reason=="small_business"|
                           reason=="wedding"|reason=="other", "other",
                          ifelse(reason == "credit_card", "credit_card",
                          ifelse(reason == "debt_consolidation", "debt_consolidation",
                          ifelse(reason == "home_improvement", "home_improvement", NA)))))%>%
  select(1:status, status2, reason, reason2, everything()) #puts new cols next to old respective partner cols for easy comparison

summary(loan_predictors3$reason2) #check that reason2 was made
```
Next we'll convert the converted cols from char to factors for consistency.
```{r}
loan_predictors3 <- loan_predictors3 %>%
  #mutate to convert chars in status2 and reason2 to factors
  mutate(reason2=as.factor(reason2), 
         status2=as.factor(status2)) 
#keeps everything cleaner when using summary(), can easily see counts

summary(loan_predictors3$reason2) #test print
summary(loan_predictors3$status2) #test print
```
Next we'll make some summary plots for the report to quicky summarize what was done in the prior few steps.
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
p5 <- ggplot(data=loan_predictors2, aes(x=reason)) + 
      geom_bar(fill= c("azure3","#F21A00","#3B9AB2","#E1AF00",
                       "azure3","azure3","azure3","azure3",
                       "azure3","azure3","azure3","azure3",
                       "azure3"))+
      xlab("reason Variable")+
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
p6 <- ggplot(data=loan_predictors3, aes(x=reason2)) + 
      geom_bar(fill= c("#F21A00", "#3B9AB2", "#E1AF00", "azure3")) + 
      xlab("reason2 Variable") +
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
grid.arrange(p5,p6,ncol=2, top = textGrob("Side by Side of Consolidation of Reason Variable"))
```
#Part1 - Section 3, Bullet 4
Next we'll remove aberant NAs concentrated in variables (i.e. bcOpen and revolRatio). Count NAs for revolRatio, for instance, is so small we can just delete the rows with NAs without attempting imputation since our data set is so large (347/50000 â‰ˆ 1%).
```{r,  results=FALSE}
NAind <- which(is.na(loan_predictors3$revolRatio) | is.na(loan_predictors3$bcOpen)) #capture all rows with NA in revolRatio
NAind[1:100] #quick look at first 100 results of the vector of NA indices
length(NAind) #check length of the vector
```

```{r}
#remove entire rows containing NAs in revolRatio and bcOpen
loan_predictors4 <- loan_predictors3[-NAind,] #save as a new dataframe
```

```{r}
#check summary to make sure NAs removed from new var loan_predictors4
NA_cols <- c("revolRatio", "bcOpen")
summary(loan_predictors4[NA_cols])
#NAs removed
nrow(loan_predictors4) #make sure tally makes sense
```
No longer NAs in revolRatio and bcOpen confirming removal.

#Part1 - Section 4, Bullet 1
With a clean data frame we can begin transforming the data and preparing it for logistic regression model.

Income predictor variable displays right skewness, we can explore further with a boxplot
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
#we'll go down the list and see which variables (if any) display skewness then transform them if possible
#income appears to be the first variable displaying skewness
boxplot(loan_predictors4$income,
        main="Boxplot of Income") #find any extreme outliers
maxIncome_ind <- which(loan_predictors4$income == max(loan_predictors4$income)) #find index of the max outlier
maxIncome_ind #test print index of max value
loan_predictors4$income[maxIncome_ind] #test print value of max value index to make sure it makes sense
```
The boxplot displays one extremely high outlier so we'll remove the entire row because someone making $7 million a year is to extreme to include as a predictor. Digging further, they also are a registered nurse and still rent. I suppose it *could* be possible they're making that much but it's very likely an entry error. Regardless we'll remove the entire row.
```{r}
#remove row of likely entry error for income
loan_predictors5 <- loan_predictors4[-maxIncome_ind,]
```
Recheck skewness to see if the outlier removal made a difference.
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
hist(loan_predictors5$income,
     main="Histogram of Income (Skewed)")
boxplot(loan_predictors5$income,
        main="Boxplot of Income (Skewed)")
```

The data looks better without that extreme outlier but is still skewed; this can be remedied by taking the log of the vector.
```{r}
income_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors5$income)
hist(income_unskewed,
     main="Histogram of Income (Unskewed)",
     xlab="log of Income")

```

We can then insert the newly created, unskewed data back into a new dataframe.
```{r}
loan_predictors6 <- add_column(loan_predictors5, income_unskewed, .after="income") #add_column comes from the tibble package
income_cols <- c("income", "income_unskewed")
summary(loan_predictors6[income_cols]) #test print
```
```{r}
#put the graphs side by side to see difference
bins7 <- seq(0,400000,by=20000)
bins8 <- seq(8,14,by=.5)
p7 <- ggplot(data=loan_predictors5, aes(x=income)) + 
      geom_histogram(fill= "#3B9AB2", breaks=bins7)+
      xlab("Income")+
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
p8 <- ggplot(data=loan_predictors6, aes(x=income_unskewed)) + 
      geom_histogram(fill= "#3B9AB2", breaks=bins8) + 
      xlab("Income (Unskewed)") +
      ylab("Counts")+
      theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0))
grid.arrange(p7,p8,ncol=2, top = textGrob("Removing Skewness of Income Variable"))
```
Now we can repeat this process for the remaining 14 variables identified as having a positive skew.

delinq2yr
inq6mth
openAcc
pubRec
totalAcc
totalBal
totalRevLim
accOpen24
avgBal
bcOpen
totalLim
totalRevBal
totalBcLim
totalIlLim

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
#vars identified with strong positive skew, use logarithmic transformation (and +1 if necessary)...
delinq2yr_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$delinq2yr+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf later
inq6mth_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$inq6mth+1) 
openAcc_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$openAcc)
pubRec_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$pubRec+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
totalAcc_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalAcc)
totalBal_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalBal+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
totalRevLim_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalRevLim)
accOpen24_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$accOpen24+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
avgBal_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$avgBal+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
bcOpen_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$bcOpen+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
totalLim_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalLim)
totalRevBal_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalRevBal+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
totalBcLim_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalBcLim+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf
totalIlLim_unskewed <- log(loan_predictors6$totalIlLim+1) #added "+1" to avoid -Inf

#use as dummy code for quick check of skewness of transformation
hist(delinq2yr_unskewed,
     main="Histogram of XXX (Unskewed)",
     xlab="log of XXX")
```
Now we can combine the data with a new dataframe which will have both original data columns AND unskewed data columns.
```{r, results="hide"}
#add_column comes from the tibble package
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors6, delinq2yr_unskewed, .after="delinq2yr")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, inq6mth_unskewed, .after="inq6mth")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, openAcc_unskewed, .after="openAcc")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, pubRec_unskewed, .after="pubRec")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalAcc_unskewed, .after="totalAcc")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalBal_unskewed, .after="totalBal")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalRevLim_unskewed, .after="totalRevLim")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, accOpen24_unskewed, .after="accOpen24")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, avgBal_unskewed, .after="avgBal")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, bcOpen_unskewed, .after="bcOpen")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalLim_unskewed, .after="totalLim")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalRevBal_unskewed, .after="totalRevBal")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalBcLim_unskewed, .after="totalBcLim")
loan_predictors7skewComposite <- add_column(loan_predictors7skewComposite, totalIlLim_unskewed, .after="totalIlLim")

#check the summary to ensure all cols were added
summary(loan_predictors7skewComposite)
```
Looks like they were all added correctly in the latest dataframe "loan_predictors7skewComposite". This will keep all the dataframes separate in case we need to go back in the history and use a different iteration without undoing all the work completed to this point. This may seem like unnecessary work but when performing logarithmic regression its best to have as many variables as possible to settle on the best combination of variables. 

#Part1 - Section 4, Bullet 2
We'll start by exploring relationships graphically between status2 and income...
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
income_status2bp <- ggplot(loan_predictors6, aes(x=status2, y=income_unskewed,fill=status2))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = status2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#F21A00", "#78B7C5"))

income_status2bp
```
Very interesting that income seems almost exactly the same for good and bad loans (good loans have *slightly* higher-paid borrowers).
```{r, fig.show='hide'}
income_gradebp <- ggplot(loan_predictors6, aes(x=grade, y=log(income),fill=grade))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = grade)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1", n = 7, type = "continuous"))
income_gradebp
```
Again, income vs. loan grade seems almost distributed equally (with a *slight* downward trend from A to G).
```{r}
rateStatus2_bp <- ggplot(loan_predictors6, aes(x=status2, y=rate,fill=status2))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = status2)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  xlab("Loan Status")+
  ylab("Rate")+
  ggtitle("Loan Rate Comparison for Good and Bad Loans")+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#F21A00", "#78B7C5"))
rateStatus2_bp

```
Looks like a good loans tend to have lower rates, though this is likely an effect of having better credit

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#explore amount of credit checks in the last 6months for good vs bad loans
badLoans <- which(loan_predictors6$status2 == "Bad")
inq6mth_bad <- loan_predictors6$inq6mth[badLoans]
# inq6mth_bad
mean(inq6mth_bad) #test print
# badLoans[1:100] #test print

goodLoans <- which(loan_predictors6$status2 == "Good")
inq6mth_good <- loan_predictors6$inq6mth[goodLoans]
mean(inq6mth_good)

```
Seems that bad loans have had slightly higher mean number of credit checks in the last 6 months.
```{r}
df_homestatus2 <- data.frame(loan_predictors6$status2,loan_predictors6$home)
ggplot(df_homestatus2,aes(loan_predictors6$status2, ..count..))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill=loan_predictors6$home), position = "dodge")+
  labs(fill="Home Ownership")+
  xlab("Loan Status")+
  ylab("Counts")+
  ggtitle("Home Ownership Comparison for Good and Bad Loans")+
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Zissou1", n = 3))+
  geom_hline(yintercept=3500, linetype="dashed", color = "#F21A00")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=10325, linetype="dashed", color = "#F21A00")
 
  
```
Note that for Good loans the Mortage rate is much higher than renting whereas, with Bad loans it's actually slightly lower than renting. This is an indicator of a potential correlation between having a mortgage and being a good borrower candidate.

Now we can plot the two: Accuracies vs Threshold
```{r}

#  PART 2 - Section 7, Bullet 1
Apply same method to maximize profit
```{r, results="hide"}
#create a new data frame with the predicted probabilities from the test data
df20testProfit <- data.frame("predictedProbs"=testprobs)
df20testProfit #test print

```

```{r, results="hide"}
#add needed cols to data frame
df20testProfit$status3 <- df20test$status3
df20testProfit$totalPaid <- df20test$totalPaid
df20testProfit$amount <- df20test$amount

#create profit col in data frame
df20testProfit$profit <- df20testProfit$totalPaid - df20testProfit$amount
df20testProfit #test print
```
Next we'll put a conditional in to tally the profit if probability is above given threshold
```{r, results="hide"}
#toggle threshold to adjust loans to keep
profitThresh <- filter(df20testProfit, predictedProbs > .7)
#didn't create a code block for each threshold in interest of saving space (changed threshold to coincide with classThresh then ran code and copied in below vector correctPreds_Profit)
# profitThresh #test print

```

```{r}
#double check no vals under profit threshold
min(profitThresh$predictedProbs) #test print to ensure no values lower than threshold

#sum all profit above profit threshold
sum(profitThresh$profit)
```

From above two code blocks create profit table
```{r}
#using above code, this is the resulting vector of profit from the corresponding thresholds
correctPreds_Profit <- c(1789901, 1789901, 1789901,
                  1998812, 2285836, 2893150,
                  3673684, 4011922, 3504955,
                  1885314, 0)

profitTable <- data.frame("threshold"= classThresh, "profit"= correctPreds_Profit,
                          "profitMil"=correctPreds_Profit/1000000) #add profit in millions for clarity
profitTable
```

Now we can plot the two: Profit vs Threshold
```{r}
barplot(profitTable$profitMil,
        names.arg=profitTable$threshold,
        xlab="Threshold",
        ylab="Profit (in Millions of $)",

```
At threshold of 0.7 we have a high type II error (accepting about as many actual bad loans as rejecting), but making the most profit.

Create model that denies all truly bad loans (and accepts only good loans) to compare a perfect model
```{r}
trulyGood <- filter(df20testProfit, status3 == 1)
# trulyGood #test print to see data

# min(trulyGood$profit) #test print to see lowest profit
sum(trulyGood$profit)
```
Profit of bank without model.

nomodelProfit <- sum(df20testProfit$profit)
nomodelProfit
